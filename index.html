            I would say São paulo is London in latin america, because in brazil que say São
            paulo is the land of drizzle.
            One of the oldest citys in the whole country, very much like every single capital around
            the world, people wake up really
            early and go to sleep late. São paulo, is one of the cities with the most diverse
            population of citizens in the world. You can basically do anything you want here, at any
            time, anywhere.
            Wanna go dance samba util 6 am ? its feasible
            Do you want to go to a rock metal concert on tuesday ? Possible
            Would you like to have morrocan, greek and thai desserts for a get together ? Easy peasy
            You can have it all as long as you have the means to pay, for the most expensive city on
            the country.</p>
